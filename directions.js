		<p class="app-text">Modern Portfolio Theory assumes investors are risk adverse. Meaning given two portfolios offering the same return the investor will prefer to invest money in the less risky one.</p>
		<p class="app-text">Diversification happens when risky stocks are combined together into a portfolio and the overall combined risk is lowered due to offsetting movements in stock prices.  Some stocks go up while others go down.</p>
		<p class="app-text">The tangency portfolio is identified by a combination of stock weights. It is desirable to know where the tangency portfolio lies in a risk versus return trade-off because this portfolio has desirable qualities.</p>
		<p class="app-text">Of note is work by a nobel prize winning professor.  His last name is Sharpe and he explained the tangent portfolio has stock weights yielding the highest Sharpe Ratio (named after him.)  This concept can be visaulized as the slope of the line connecting the risk-free rate to the tangent portfolio.</p>
		<p class="app-text">Treasuries (especially T-bills) are considered to be risk-free because they are backed by the U.S. government.</p>
