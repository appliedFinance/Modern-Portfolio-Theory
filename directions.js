		<p class="app-title">Tangent Portfolio Finder</p>
		<p class="app-text">Modern Portfolio Theory assumes investors are risk adverse, meaning given two portfolios offering equivalent expected-return an investor will prefer to invest money in the less risky one.</p>
		<p class="app-text">Diversification happens when risky stocks are combined together into a portfolio and the overall combined risk is lowered due to offsetting movements in stock prices.  Some stocks go up while others go down.</p>
		<p class="app-text">The tangency portfolio is identified by a unique collection of stock weights.  It is desirable to know where the tangency portfolio lies in a risk versus return trade-off because this portfolio has very awesome qualities.</p>
		<p class="app-text">Of note is the nobel prize winning work by Prof. Sharpe who explained the tangent portfolio has weights yielding the highest Sharpe Ration (named after him.)  This concept can be visaulized as the slope of the line connecting the risk-free rate to the tangent portfolio.
